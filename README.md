Cuddle - Easier Support System That Reaching Out To You First

## Application Overview
Cuddle is a mental health service that is design to guide our citizen to find a right service quickly and easily.

Current Support System expects people to know their current mental status and expect to search for a right sevice themself.
This can be very daunting task for those who are not feeling 100% mentally.

In constrast, our Cuddle first estimate most commonly occuring mental diseases based on user's age, gender, and ethnicity.
It displays and explain these potential mental diseases.
Based on the estimate, it recommands a simple customized survey to diagonos the disease better.
Then, it finally provides the right support service for the patient quickly.

## Background
Cuddle makes statistical prediction based on previously collected health dataset.
The research shows there are strong dependency between mental disease and person's age, gender, ethnicity, and etc.

## Challenges
1. Minding and reformating the required data from a vast dataset from health organization
2. Generating the meaning out by manipulating and combining multiple datasets.
3. Use statistical techniques for predicting the diseases likelihood.
4. Designing and implementing a simple and easy interface for the user.
5. Effectively displayig information to the users and encourage them to take next diagonosis survey.

## Future works
Due to access and availability limitation of publicly available dataset, we could not extend our prediction beyond age, gender, and ethnicity.
It could be interesting to include income, residential region, job status/type, and etc., into mental disease estimation.
